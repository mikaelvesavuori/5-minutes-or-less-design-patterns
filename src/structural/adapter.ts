/**
 * **Adapter**
 *
 * > "Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
 * Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
 * incompatible interfaces."
 *
 * When you need to hook up incompatible objects you might want to
 * consider the Adapter pattern. It provides the possibility to adapt
 * the interface of one thing into another.
 *
 * A good analogy is two people speaking with each other, but none of them
 * knowing the language of the other. How to solve this situation? By
 * using an adapter of course!
 *
 * The adapter typically extends or implements one of the parties, in order
 * to stay true to the destination's interface and contract.
 *
 * You'll typically witness this pattern in integration contexts, as it's
 * common to use something like this to make sure both origin and recipient can
 * stay "unpolluted" in their data, contracts, and interfaces. Instead, by
 * having the adapter in-between it will be responsibility of it to take care
 * of that translation.

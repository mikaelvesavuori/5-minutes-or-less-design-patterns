/**
 * **Composite**
 *
 * > "Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
 * Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects
 * uniformly."
 *
 * Sounds great, but maybe a bit puzzling. Again, given an example, you'll
 * see it's quite clear.
 *
 * We'll create a company that consists of teams. Each team has zero or more employees
 * with a few different roles (developer or designer).
 *
 * In our case, the "leafs" will be the employees, and the "composites" are
 * the teams (even the company is just a team of teams). The "component"
 * each object uses is the `Employee` interface.

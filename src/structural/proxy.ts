/**
 * **Proxy**
 *
 * > "Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it."
 *
 * This behavior can be approximated with, but should not be confused with, the JavaScript Proxy object.
 * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy
 *
 * A proxy is essentially a stand-in or placeholder for something.
 * The proxy pattern is useful when we, rather than manipulate the right thing,
 * can manipulate the proxy.
 *
 * In Design Patterns, the example is given of a resource-intensive image that is
 * only loaded when needed, though we still require using it to know its size etc.
 * We will use the same kind of example here.

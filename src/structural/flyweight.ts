/**
 * **Flyweight**
 *
 * > "Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
 * efficiently."
 *
 * This pattern is specifically aimed to optimize for memory use
 * when dealing with significant numbers of similar objects.
 *
 * Flyweight should only be considered if object identity is not
 * important. If it is, we can't use it.
 *
 * There are a few concepts to keep in mind with this one:
 * - The Flyweight interface, which (as any interface) expresses
 * what can be done on it.
 * - The concrete Flyweight, which will contain shared state across
 * all Flyweights.
 * - The Flyweight factory, which manages Flyweights.
 *
 * State is "intrinsic" (shared) or "extrinsic" (unique).
 * By minimizing the use of extrinsic or unique data, we
 * can effectively reduce the amount of memory used.
 *
 * Note that one drawback is that we have to make more
 * look-ups to find the correct Flyweight.

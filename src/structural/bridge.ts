/**
 * **Bridge**
 *
 * > "Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently."
 *
 * The Bridge decouples implementation and abstractions.
 * If this smells of general polymorphism it's because it's not
 * too far off!
 *
 * In our example, we'll create a high-level abstraction (the `ElectronicDevice`)
 * which any number of classes can implement. This way, they can evolve
 * to their own needs, but still be based on shared interfaces.
 *
 * You know that you have a Bridge when you can independently evolve lower-level
 * classes based off of the bridging interface.

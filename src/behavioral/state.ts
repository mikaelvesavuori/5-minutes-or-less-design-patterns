/**
 * **State**
 *
 * > "Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
 * The object will appear to change its class."
 *
 * In front-end applications and games it's super common to encounter state,
 * because these types of systems are heavily reliant on states of UIs, players,
 * inventories, and whatever knick-knacks you can think of.
 *
 * The State pattern, then, is a pattern meant to express the states of an object
 * and how the object can change its state based on those states. Consequently,
 * making state transitions explicit is an effect of using the pattern.
 *
 * While state can be shared, don't forget to think about who "owns" the transitions.
 * In our demo, this is clear, but your case may get more polluted.
 *
 * In closing, It's quite straightforward to implement, and it's useful in numerous cases.
 *
 * Below, let's check it out for a lighting system.

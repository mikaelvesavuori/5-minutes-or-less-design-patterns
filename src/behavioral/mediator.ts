/**
 * **Mediator**
 *
 * > "Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
 * Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other
 * explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently."
 *
 * In short, the Mediator pattern centralizes communication between objects.
 * It makes it fairly easy to wire up many behaviors into one object. While not
 * the most sophisticated approach, I think this is useful for a lot of cases.
 *
 * For it to work, we distinguish between the Mediator (which "owns" and
 * brokers the communication) and the colleagues (which "use" the Mediator).
 *
 * While not following the pattern, I've often used (and seen) this type of
 * pattern used with direct references to (for example in games) Manager classes
 * rather than having them injected at (here: User) creation time. It does
 * look better when done as shown here, though!
 *
 * In our demo, we'll check a chat room with users. We'll defer to the chat room,
 * acting as a mediator, to actually send messages.

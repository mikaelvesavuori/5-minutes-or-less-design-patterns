/**
 * **Iterator**
 *
 * > "Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
 * sequentially without exposing its underlying representation."
 *
 * It's worth mentioning first that iterators and generators are
 * natively supported in JavaScript. I mean, you already know about
 * arrays and various ways of iterating over them, or other types of
 * collections.
 *
 * The big deal with the Iterator pattern is that it's independent
 * of any language constructs, and that you can make it work as
 * flexibly as you want (and are able to code it). This allows us
 * to add entirely custom iteration capabilities, which makes sense
 * when we deal with custom-made objects.
 *
 * For our example, we are going to see a music playlist.
 * In the music playlist we can asdf.

/**
 * **Template Method**
 *
 * > "Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps
 * to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of
 * an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure."
 *
 * This pattern uses good old object-oriented programming and inheritance to set
 * up an abstract class that concretions can define as they need.
 *
 * Where it differs to other behavioral patterns - such as Strategy or Composite - is
 * that this allows, first and foremost, providing functionality from the template
 * itself, and combining this with a sequential prepackaged Factory/Builder-like API.
 *
 * You might want to use this when there are parts of a codebase that have things in
 * common, but where details may sometimes drift a bit. With the flexibility of a
 * Template Method, you can address both "messy reality" while still refactoring to
 * a sensible and clean pattern.
 *
 * Our demo this time is of a travel plan that needs to accomodate both solo and
 * family plans.

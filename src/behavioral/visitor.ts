/**
 * **Visitor**
 *
 * > "Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
 * Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the
 * elements on which it operates."
 *
 * Also a popular pattern in JavaScript is the use of the Visitor. It's quite common that
 * we balance concerns like "what does the object do (what is it responsible for?"
 * and "what can I decouple elsewhere?" on a daily basis. The Visitor allows doing both!
 *
 * The primary utility of the pattern is to allow separation of behavior from classes.
 * The pattern works by introducing a middle-man (the Visitor) that we can inject into
 * classes which may "accept" it. These classes can also combine the methods of the
 * Visitor with its own functionality. This way we can use both internal, as well as external,
 * logic with our objects.
 *
 * What about inheritance? Well, inheritance can easily become complicated and messy.
 * It's also not necessarily the solution to the problem of introducing logic, as the
 * Visitor can be used for objects that don't derive from the same superclasses -
 * ultimately making this powerful and flexible for many types of use cases.
 *
 * A couple of concerns with this pattern is to stay wary of breaking encapsulation (if
 * details and interfaces start spilling out uncontrollably), chaotic indirection of
 * classes and visitors, and the possibility of breaking domain logic away from their
 * logical constructs/classes (which is not a good thing).

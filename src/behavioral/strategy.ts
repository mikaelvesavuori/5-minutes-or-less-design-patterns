/**
 * **Strategy**
 *
 * > "Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
 * interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients
 * that use it."
 *
 * Strategy is a super neat pattern that lets you switch out implementations in
 * runtime without having to change the code that uses it. It's good for most
 * non-trivial use cases where you'd otherwise end up with bloated logic and
 * if/else hellscapes. In fact, as an effect of the pattern, there should be no
 * (or minimal) conditional statements left, as they aren't needed for handling
 * behavior.
 *
 * Obviously, to use Strategy, your classes should differ only in behavior.
 *
 * Because it's closely related to dependency injection, you get all the same
 * benefits, like better composed code, easier testing, and more predictable behavior.
 *

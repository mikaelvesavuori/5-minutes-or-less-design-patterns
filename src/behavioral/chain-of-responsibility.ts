/**
 * **Chain of Responsibility**
 *
 * > "Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
 * than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and
 * pass the request along the chain until an object handles it."
 *
 * This pattern allows chaining of objects to handle a request.
 * It works especially well when you know there are multiple objects that
 * can handle the request, but you don't know which one will handle it.
 *
 * In the demonstration, we can set the next handler for either of
 * the two example implementations for Basic and Premium support.
 * By setting this, we can funnel a request that began at a
 * "lower level" into higher levels.
